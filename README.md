Hi, I’m Cyle, an undergraduate student in information science at the University of Urbana-Champaign. I have experience in modding for Europa Universalis 4 (EU4), a historical simulation built in C++ and PDX Script. My published mod, Soldier's Song, expands gameplay for Irish petty kingdoms, known as túatha, and integrates various mechanics within the simulation within historical and cultural/mythological contexts.

Currently, I’m collaborating on a more ambitious world-building project for the recently released EU5, where we’re fostering an entire world with unique, fantastical cultures, religions, and political systems. I have also worked on academic projects utilising Java, Python, SQL, and CSV, as well as personal projects that employed HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SVG.

Outside of programming, I love cats and anything lavender-related, and admittedly suffer a mild addiction to teas, particularly Earl Grey. I’m passionate about learning new concepts and tools to enhance my programming capabilities, so feel free to challenge me with any project or problem, big or small!
